## 1. System requirements
- OpenCV software version 4.0 or newer
- Tesseract software version 5.0 or newer
      
### Things that needs to be done
    
- [x] First successful plate recognition   
- [ ] Implement User Interface
- [ ] Prepare proper documentation of code
- [ ] Testing software which diffrent photos of vivid quality
